# Ironhack - Mid-Bootcamp Project

## Business Background

**Position:** Risk Analyst  
**Business:** Bank  
**Business Services:** Banking, Loans, Credit Cards  
**Business Objective:** Understanding the demographics/characteristics of customers that accept/do not accept credit cards + adjacent findings  
**Data Gathering Process:** The bank designed a focused marketing study, with 18,000 current bank customers. This focused approach allows the bank to know who does and does not respond to the credit card offer, and to use existing demographic data already available on each customer.  

## Data Science Background

> These are the definitions of data points provided:

**Data Science Objectives:** 
- Find the type of clients accepting credit card offers
- Build a classification model able to predict if future customers are likely to accept a credit card offer based on their characteristics (to allow targetted customer offers)
- Offer recommendations to the bank based on findings, e.g. if it should focus more on a specific type of loyalty program or client type
- Provide ideas for further exploration & analysis, e.g. which credit card customer segment is the most profitable
